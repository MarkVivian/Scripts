.\get_wifi_passwords_parallel_processing.ps1

# Later runs - only adds new profiles (no duplicates)
.\get_wifi_passwords_parallel_processing.ps1
```

## Parallel Processing

### How It Works
The script uses PowerShell background jobs to process profiles in parallel:

1. **Profile Analysis:** Calculates optimal number of jobs based on profile count
2. **Job Distribution:** Divides profiles evenly across processing jobs
3. **Duplicate Detection:** Each job checks for existing profiles independently
4. **Result Aggregation:** Combines results from all jobs efficiently

### Job Calculation Algorithm
```powershell
# Dynamic job allocation based on profile count
if (√profiles ≤ 50) → 2 jobs
elseif (∛profiles ≤ 50) → 3 jobs
else → 4-5 jobs (based on complexity)
```

### Performance Benefits
- **Small Networks (≤25 profiles):** 2x faster processing
- **Medium Networks (26-125 profiles):** 3x faster processing  
- **Large Networks (>125 profiles):** 4-5x faster processing

### Memory Usage
- **Per Job:** ~10-20MB during processing
- **Peak Usage:** Scales with number of profiles and jobs
- **Cleanup:** Automatic job disposal after completion

## Output Format

### File Structure
The script creates `WifiProfilesAndKeys.txt` with this format:

```
Profile: NetworkName1
Key: password123

Profile: NetworkName2  
Key: mySecurePassword

Profile: GuestNetwork
Key: No key found
```

### Content Details
- **Profile Line:** Contains the exact WiFi network name (SSID)
- **Key Line:** Contains the password or "No key found" for open networks
- **Spacing:** Empty line between each profile for readability
- **Encoding:** UTF-8 to support international characters

### Incremental Updates
When run multiple times:
- **First Run:** Creates file with all current profiles
- **Subsequent Runs:** Appends only new profiles found
- **Duplicate Prevention:** Compares both profile name and password
- **Update Notification:** Shows count of newly added profiles

## Performance Optimization

### Profile Count Thresholds
The script optimizes based on your network environment:

| Profile Count | Jobs | Use Case | Expected Performance |
|---------------|------|----------|---------------------|
| 1-25 | 2 | Home/Small Office | ~2 seconds |
| 26-125 | 3 | Medium Business | ~3-5 seconds |
| 126+ | 4-5 | Enterprise/Campus | ~5-10 seconds |

### System Resource Usage
- **CPU:** Brief spike during parallel processing
- **Memory:** 50-200MB depending on profile count
- **Disk:** Minimal - only writes new entries
- **Network:** None - processes local data only

### Optimization Tips
1. **Run as Administrator** for access to all system profiles
2. **Use SSD storage** for faster file operations
3. **Close unnecessary applications** during processing
4. **Use debug mode** to identify performance bottlenecks

## Security Considerations

### Important Security Notes
⚠️ **WARNING:** This script extracts plaintext passwords from your system

### Data Protection
- **File Permissions:** Ensure output file has restricted access
- **Storage Location:** Choose secure directory with appropriate permissions
- **Transmission:** Never send password files over unencrypted channels
- **Cleanup:** Delete password files after use when possible

### Recommended Security Practices
```powershell
# Set restrictive file permissions after creation
icacls "WifiProfilesAndKeys.txt" /inheritance:r /grant:r "$env:USERNAME:(R,W)"

# Encrypt the output file (optional)
cipher /e "WifiProfilesAndKeys.txt"
```

### Legal and Ethical Considerations
- **Own Systems Only:** Only run on systems you own or have explicit permission to access
- **Corporate Policies:** Check company IT policies before extracting network credentials
- **Data Retention:** Follow organizational data retention policies
- **Access Control:** Limit access to extracted credentials

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Execution Policy" Error
```
File cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled
```
**Solution:**
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

#### No Profiles Found
```
The script runs but finds no WiFi profiles
```
**Causes & Solutions:**
- **No saved networks:** Connect to WiFi networks first
- **Insufficient permissions:** Run as Administrator
- **WiFi disabled:** Enable WiFi adapter in Device Manager

#### Path Does Not Exist Error
```
The path [custom_path] does not exist
```
**Solution:**
```powershell
# Create the directory first
New-Item -Path "C:\CustomPath" -ItemType Directory -Force
```

#### Performance Issues
**Symptoms:** Script runs slowly or uses excessive memory
**Solutions:**
1. **Reduce job count manually** by modifying the calculator function
2. **Use debug mode** to identify bottlenecks
3. **Close other applications** to free system resources

### Debug Output Analysis
When using `-DebugMode`, look for:
```
DEBUG: the existing content count is 45
DEBUG: the number of jobs is 3
DEBUG: the number of profiles per job is 15
```

### Advanced Troubleshooting
```powershell
# Test netsh functionality manually
netsh wlan show profiles

# Verify PowerShell job capability
Get-Job | Remove-Job -Force

# Check available system memory
Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_OperatingSystem | Select-Object TotalVisibleMemorySize, FreePhysicalMemory
```

## Best Practices

### Before Running
1. **Run as Administrator** for complete profile access
2. **Create secure output directory** with restricted permissions
3. **Close sensitive applications** before extracting passwords
4. **Verify disk space** for output file

### During Extraction
- **Don't interrupt** the parallel processing jobs
- **Monitor system resources** if running on older hardware
- **Use debug mode** for first-time runs to verify functionality

### After Extraction
1. **Verify output file** contains expected profiles
2. **Set appropriate file permissions** for security
3. **Backup safely** if needed for system migration
4. **Secure deletion** when no longer needed

### File Management
```powershell
# Create secure backup
$secureLocation = "C:\SecureBackup"
Copy-Item "WifiProfilesAndKeys.txt" "$secureLocation\WiFi-$(Get-Date -Format 'yyyyMMdd').txt"

# Secure deletion when done
sdelete -z -p 3 "WifiProfilesAndKeys.txt"
```
